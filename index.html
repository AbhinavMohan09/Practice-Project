  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

      <p id="lyrics">Take me down to the Paradise City<br>
        Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty (take me home)<br>
        Oh, won't you please take me home?<br>
        Take me down to the Paradise City<br>
        Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty (take me home)<br>
        Oh, won't you please take me home?<br>
        Just an urchin living under the street, I'm a<br>
        Hard case that's tough to beat<br>
        I'm your charity case so buy me somethin' to eat<br>
        I'll pay you at another time<br>
        Take it to the end of the line<br>
        Rags and riches, or so they say, you gotta<br>
        Keep pushing for the fortune and fame<br>
        You know it's, it's all a gamble when it's just a game<br>
        You treat it like a capital crime<br>
        Everybody's doing their time<br>
        Take me down to the Paradise City<br>
        Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty<br>
        Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah-yeah<br>
        Take me down to the Paradise City<br>
        Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty<br>
        Take me home<br>
        Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber<br>
        Why I'm here, I can't quite remember<br>
        The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe<br>
        I'd have another cigarette but I can't see<br>
        Tell me, who you're gonna believe?<br>
        Take me down to the Paradise City<br>
        Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty<br>
        Take me home, yeah-yeah<br>
        Take me down to the Paradise City<br>
        Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty<br>
        Oh, won't you please take me home?<br>
        Yeah<br>
        So far away<br>
        So far away<br>
        So far away<br>
        So far away<br>
        Captain America's been torn apart, now<br>
        He's a court jester with a broken heart<br>
        He said, "Turn me around and take me back to the start"<br>
        I must be losin' my mind, "Are you blind?"<br>
        "I've seen it all a million times"<br>

      </h2>
      <p id="lyrics">She's got a smile that it seems to me<br>
        Reminds me of childhood memories<br>
        Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)<br>
        Now and then when I see her face<br>
        She takes me away to that special place<br>
        And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry<br>
        <br>
        Whoa-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine<br>
        Whoa, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine<br>
        <br>
        She's got eyes of the bluest skies<br>
        As if they thought of rain<br>
        I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain<br>
        Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place<br>
        Where as a child I'd hide<br>
        And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by<br>
        <br>
        Whoa-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine<br>
        Ooh, oh-oh-oh! Sweet love of mine<br>
        <br>
        Oh yeah! Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine<br>
        Ooh-oh, oh, oh! Sweet love of mine<br>
        Whoa, oh-oh-oh! Sweet child o' mine, ooh yeah<br>
        Ooh! Sweet love of mine<br>
        <br>
        Where do we go?<br>
        Where do we go now?<br>
        Where do we go?<br>
        Ooh, where do we go?<br>
        Where do we go now?<br>
        Oh, where do we go now?<br>
        Where do we go? (Sweet child)<br>
        Ooh, where do we go now?<br>
        Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay<br>
        Where do we go now? Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, wow<br>
        Where do we go?<br>
        Oh, where do we go now?<br>
        Oh, where do we go?<br>
        Where do we go now?<br>

      </h2>
      <p id="lyrics">Welcome to the jungle, we got fun and games<br>
        We got everything you want, honey, we know the names<br>
        We are the people that can find whatever you may need<br>
        If you got the money, honey, we got your disease<br>
        <br>
        In the jungle, welcome to the jungle<br>
        Watch it bring you to your shun-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees<br>
        Muah, ah, I wanna watch you bleed<br>
        <br>
        Welcome to the jungle, we take it day-by-day<br>
        If you want it you're gonna bleed, but it's the price you pay<br>
        And you're a very sexy girl, who's very hard to please<br>
        You can taste the bright lights, but you won't get them for free<br>
        <br>
        In the jungle, welcome to the jungle<br>
        Feel my, my, my, my serpentine<br>
        Oh, ah, I wanna hear you scream<br>
        
        Welcome to the jungle, it gets worse here every day<br>
        You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play<br>
        If you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually<br>
        You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me<br>
        
        In the jungle, welcome to the jungle<br>
        Watch it bring you to your shun-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees<br>
        Muah, I'm gonna watch you bleed<br>
        <br>
        And when you're high, you never ever wanna come down<br>
        So down, so down, so down, yeah<br>
        <br>
        You know where you are?<br>
        You're in the jungle, baby<br>
        You're gonna die<br>
        <br>
        In the jungle, welcome to the jungle<br>
        Watch it bring you to your shun-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees<br>
        In the jungle, welcome to the jungle<br>
        Feel my, oh my, my, my serpentine<br>
        <br>
        Jungle, welcome to the jungle<br>
        Watch it bring you to your shun-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees<br>
        <br>
        Down in the jungle, welcome to the jungle<br>
        Watch it bring you to yourâ€”it's gonna bring you down, huh<br>
